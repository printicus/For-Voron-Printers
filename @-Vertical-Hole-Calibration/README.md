This is ment for tuning vertical holes for screws and such, in Super Slicer.
For now its the only slicer that can do that(that i know) whitout modifying the whole part.
For me, a value of -0.19 in the "Vertical Hole shrinking compensaion" box does the trick for Polymaker ASA. If a part has a 3mm vertical hole in cad, it will come out 3mm after printing.
For you it can be(and probably it will be) another value. The "trick" is to test the hole with the shaft from a drillbit that has the same diameter as the hole you are testing, and it must go in easy but without wiggling. That will be close enough.
