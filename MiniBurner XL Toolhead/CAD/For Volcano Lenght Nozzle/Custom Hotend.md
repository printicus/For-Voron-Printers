Witch can be used with one of these heatblocks:

 or just a simple volcano heatblock.

The Trianglelab CHCB-V with his original heatsink and heatbreak is not compatible with "Main Body for Volcano Heatblock - 21mm heatsink", becouse the owerall lenght is shorter and the heatsink is bigger in diameter. For this the part its called "Main Body for Trianglelab CHCB-V".
