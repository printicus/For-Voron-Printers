# For Voron Printers
Parts, modded parts and accessories for Voron Printers

These are a ME project. I designet, remixed or modded these files for me, but I uploaded them here, maybe someone will find them interesting and will want to use them. I use Super Slicer as my slicer of choice, wich has an option for "Vertical Hole shrinking compensation" that allows me to tune vertical holes diameter without modifying other dimensions. That will make the vertical holes a bit smaller when my files are used with other slicers, especially for holes use for selftapping. Be aware of that, or parts will break!

I included a file for vertical hole tuning if you want to do that.
